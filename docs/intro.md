# What is this thing?

I donâ€™t use Facebook but many of my friends do. I wanted a way to let my friends know that I would not receive their messages unless they sent them some other way.

`fbautorespond` allows you to set up a simple auto-responder that will be sent to people who converse with you on Facebook messenger.
